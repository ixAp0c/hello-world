# hello-world
A place to store configuration files & other things for personal system administration. This repository exists in case of a system failure, for an accessible way to quickly revert a fresh bare-bones system into a more usable desktop.

Configuration files are for [i3wm](https://www.i3wm.org), [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), and [Xorg](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/xorg).

All files are free to use.
